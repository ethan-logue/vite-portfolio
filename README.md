# Welcome to my Portfolio!

This branch is where I'm working on a new version of my site incorporating GSAP and Three.js. I'm new to both of these libraries, so I'm excited to see what I can do with them!

## Work in Progress
- Custom Cursor
    - [x] General appearance
    - [x] Context hook for easy manipulation
    - [x] Abstract event handlers
- Home Page
    - [x] Find a noise texture for the background
    - [x] Finalize design sketch
    - [x] CodeWindow tilt effect
    - [ ] FlowerScene added

## Bugs
- [x] Cursor stays on page when mouse leaves viewport
- [x] Custom cursor appears on mobile when clicking
- [ ] FlowerScene is not effected by light properly
