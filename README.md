# Welcome to my Portfolio!

This branch is where I'm working on a new version of my site incorporating GSAP and Three.js. I'm new to both of these libraries and am excited to see what I can do with them!

## Work in Progress
- Custom Cursor
    - [x] General appearance
    - [x] Context hook for easy manipulation
    - [ ] Abstract event handlers
- Home Page
    - [ ] Finalize design sketch
    - [ ] Find a noise texture for the background

## Bugs
- [ ] Cursor stays on page when mouse leaves viewport
- [ ] Custom cursor appears on mobile when clicking
